					<p>My name is Ssemaganda Brian, senior three student right now. In 
coming up with this project, we discussed a group and came up with an 
idea of making website. So we decided to plan for it regardless of its 
difficulty.
Am very glad of the output though it is not all the best. Am also glad 
of myself because I took contribution of it. I conclude by saying group 
work softens. Strain is treasure

of the Lower Secondary Curriculum also known as the New Curriculum. The 
NCDC the new curriculum makes us to think wide to the extent that our 
brains are overcoming the brains of some whites but for they are greater
 than us because of the material the use which is available to the but 
in 10years to come we shall be the  source of everything in Uganda
As we give you a warm welcome to our dear parents let me pass you 
through our made website as a project of computer some the secretary of 
the group will give more contents so the use of internet also helped us 
very much in this project and to acquire more skills from it and to 
brain storm on our brains. This website will help in the advertising the
 school and the next generation will start and keep on adding the 
current events happening.

					<p>With utmost humility let me take this opportunity to greet and 
appreciate you all for visiting our website. My name is Nsereko 
Deogratious schooling from Uganda Martyrs S.S Kayunga in form three.
						Building/designing this website came up as a project we had 
thought of with my fellow students offering ICT(computer). We are also 
grateful that we have managed to fulfill the demands of the new 
curriculum of being creative and innovative under the competency of 
understanding in reality and reasoning.
						I therefore encourage all students in the new curriculum to engage
 in the understanding so as to be able solve problems in their 
societies, community and even countrywide.
